<h3 id="ch1.the-discreteness-of-cognition">The discreteness of
cognition</h3>
</div>
<p>The world may be continuous, but our cognitive apparatus that deals
with the world is at least partially discrete. George A. Miller, in his
famous paper (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1956-ju">(1956)</span>), introduced the capacity
limitation for processing the information as 7 ± 2 <em>chunks</em>.
Though a later study <span class="citation"
data-cites="Cowan2001-qn">(Cowan 2001)</span> updated the number to 4 ±
2, they did not change the key point of Miller’s theory, that the unit
of memory is a <em>chunk</em>. A chunk may consist of many smaller
units, but it can be recognized as a whole pattern. For example, a chess
expert can remember realistic positions of the pieces of a whole chess
board in several seconds <span class="citation"
data-cites="De_Groot1946-vc">(De Groot 1946)</span>. The expert has
great experience of the chess board patterns, so she/he memorized the
whole board as a few chunks or even a single chunk instead of memorizing
the chess pieces one by one. Even though most people cannot memorize the
chess board as one chunk, everyone can recognize portions of the world
by a few chunks. This ability is called <em>conceptualization</em>.</p>
<p>The ability of conceptualization is necessary to deal with the huge
amount of information received from vision, hearing, and other senses in
a human’s daily life. In vision alone, the retina can transmit about 10
million bits to the brain per second <span class="citation"
data-cites="Koch2006-gn">(Koch et al. 2006)</span>. Our brains are
powerful, but processing all the details of the received information is
still impossible. Instead, received information will be clustered into
discrete chunks that carry different concepts, such as blue sky, hot
sand, and the sound of waves. The number of concepts is much smaller
than the number of all received details, therefore humans are able to
recognize the board world with the limited processing capacity of
working memory.</p>
<p>The concept chunks are the entries or cues to meaning. They are basic
units in our cognition. It is worth noting that <em>basic</em> does not
mean <em>smallest</em>. There can be many conceptual levels: a forest
consists of trees; a tree consists of a canopy, a stem, and roots; a
canopy consists of leaves, branches; and so on and so forth. The large
hierarchy of concepts makes it hard to define the lowest level of
concepts, so it is not possible to construct concepts from the
<em>smallest</em> units. <em>Basic</em> units, instead, refer to the
units that take priority during understanding, and the priority depends
on the interpreter’s experience. For example, most people will recognize
a cat as <em>cat</em> rather than the superordinate concept
<em>mammal</em> or the subordinate concept <em>Russian Blue</em>, and a
cat owner may move their prior level to different breeds of cats<span
class="citation" data-cites="Hajibayova2013-ud">(Hajibayova
2013)</span>. Owing to the priority of the basic units in conceptual
levels, people can reduce the complicated hierarchy to a single concept.
In this thesis, I investigate the basic units of language
comprehension.</p>
<div id="the-discreteness-of-language-cognition">
<h3 id="ch1.the-discreteness-of-language-cognition">The discreteness of
language cognition</h3>
</div>
<p>Language is a part of the human world. So as in the cognition of the
world, discreteness can also be seen in the cognition apparatus dealing
with language. The world may be continuous, but language is
intrinsically discrete since it evolved from human’s discrete cognitive
actions rather than the natural environment. Units in languages include
phonemes, gestures, signs, and other symbols. If these simple symbols
are used alone, their expressive capabilities are far from adequate for
the current communication of people. However, as Wilhelm von Humboldt
summarized language as a system which “makes infinite use of finite
means” (translated and quoted by Noam Chomsky (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Chomsky2016-lc">(2016)</span>)), humans invent different
syntactic roles for symbols so the symbols can be combined to form a
short sentence, and a sentence can nest inside another sentence to
generate a longer sentence. The recursion of language allows language
users to build infinite expressions from an initially limited set of
concepts. In other words, not only is language inherently discrete, the
evolution of language has also taken advantage of its discrete
nature.</p>
<p>The discrete nature of language is apparent in its spoken and written
form. Sentences and their internal clauses are usually separated by
speech pauses, and the voice stress given to certain syllables can
indicate the separations between words, clauses, or other linguistic
units. Almost all current writing systems have punctuations and
delimiters (such as spaces). Punctuations sometimes help to disambiguate
the meaning of the text. For example, in case we remove punctuations
from “<em>Most of the time, travellers worry about their luggage.</em>”,
the sentence “<em>Most of the time travellers worry about their
luggage</em>” turns to be Sci-Fi. Also, current European and Arabic
writing systems usually put spaces in the text to indicate the
boundaries of words. The spaces play a similar role of disambiguation as
punctuations. With punctuations, spaces, and other dividers, language
users can distinguish different entities and understand the materials
more easily.</p>
<p>However, the discreteness in language forms differs from the
discreteness in language cognition. The dividers in the form are
explicit and perceptible. But a lot of discreteness in language
cognition is implicit and can be recognized only by experience. Syllable
stresses do not mark all the separations between linguistic units. A
robot voice may even lack stress cues and become monotonous, while
people can still understand it without much effort. The written styles
of Ancient Greek and Classical Latin, scriptio continua or continuous
script (<span class="citation" data-cites="Nagy2009-ih">Nagy
(2009)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nagy2009-ih">(2009)</span>, p. 5; <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rhodes2013-uq">Rhodes (2013)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rhodes2013-uq">(2013)</span>), do not use dividers like
space or punctuation. Classical Chinese text has a similar style, and
was used until about one hundred years ago. Modern Chinese added
punctuations, but still has no space between words.</p>
<p>In sum, perceptual dividers may facilitate understanding, but they
only partially mark the discrete units of language cognition. Therefore,
the discreteness of language cognition cannot be deduced merely from the
perceptual cues, which leaves the open challenge of discovering the
building blocks in language cognition. These building blocks are the
genuine language units that we memorize, perceive, and produce in our
daily life. I will name them <em>cognitive units</em> below.</p>
<div id="from-linguistic-units-to-cognitive-units">
<h3 id="ch1.from-linguistic-units-to-cognitive-units">From linguistic
units to cognitive units</h3>
</div>
<p>Ferdinand de Saussure, in his famous edited works <em>Course in
General Linguistics,</em> indicated the importance of units in language
science:</p>
<p>“... just as the game of chess is entirely in the combination of the
different chess pieces, language is characterized as a system based
entirely on the opposition of its concrete units. We can neither
dispense with becoming acquainted with them nor take a single step
without coming back to them” (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Saussure1959-rs">De Saussure (1916/1959)</span>, <span
class="citation" data-cites="Saussure1959-rs">(1916/1959)</span>,
p. 107).</p>
<p>Various branches of linguistics take some form of <em>units</em> as
the basis of their theoretical frameworks. In the following paragraphs,
I will go through different types of linguistic units that researchers
have used and discuss their relations with our desired cognitive
units.</p>
<p>Although Saussure admitted the difficulty of seizing language units
in practice, he said the word “bears a rough resemblance to the unit and
has the advantage of being concrete” (Saussure 1959, page 113). Indeed,
words are the most generally accepted units of language, either in daily
use, such as dictionary lookup and word count, in linguistics, such as
sentence parsing <span class="citation"
data-cites="Chomsky1957-dk">(Chomsky 1957)</span>, in computational
linguistics, such as word embedding <span class="citation"
data-cites="Mikolov2013-om Pennington2014-ii">(Mikolov et al. 2013;
Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</span>, or in psycholinguistics,
such as lexical decision task <span class="citation"
data-cites="Meyer1971-ej">(Meyer and Schvaneveldt 1971)</span>. The
reason behind the wide acceptance of word units is as Saussure said:
they are <em>concrete</em>. The spaces and punctuations make words
conspicuous in most texts, so it is easy for the reader to locate them
as units.</p>
<p>However, words are not always so conspicuous. For example, fluent
speech smooths the pronunciation of neighboring words into a continuum,
rather than marking the pronunciation of each word separately; and as I
have mentioned in Section <a
href="#ch1.the-discreteness-of-language-cognition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch1.the-discreteness-of-language-cognition">1.2</a>,
some writing systems lack perceptual word dividers, so even the
definitions of <em>words</em> in those systems remain ambiguous.
Moreover, we cannot say that words are cognitive units even in the
writing systems which have conspicuous words. For example, infrequent
morphologically complex words (e.g., <em>allyship</em>) or long words
(e.g., <em>pseudohypoparathyroidism</em>) should probably be decomposed
during understanding because of their unfamiliarity and composition into
meaningful parts. For those cases, morphemes, that are defined as the
linguistic form which bears no partial phonetic-semantic resemblance
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Bloomfield1933-gl">Bloomfield
(1933)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Bloomfield1933-gl">(1933)</span>, p. 161) or the minimal
meaning-bearing units in a language <span class="citation"
data-cites="Chomsky1953-zp">(Chomsky 1953)</span>, may serve as the
better candidates for cognitive units. But if morphemes serve as the
only units in cognition, the number of tokens would increase (as would
the number of operations required), and many opaque compounds (e.g.,
<em>strawman</em>) would not be understood as a whole.</p>
<p>Still, words and morphemes are the prevalent units in mainstream
linguistics. It may be because they are all defined as the
<em>minimal</em> units though under different criteria: words are the
minimal units in most syntactic theories or the minimal units between
two spaces in most European texts, and morphemes are the minimal units
bearing meaning. Taking only the <em>minimal</em> units in language
formalization is a type of reductionism, and the reductive approach can
simplify formalization. For example, words and morphemes are more
distinguishable than phrases and clauses, and words and morphemes are
also of fewer types than phrases and clauses, so the units based on
<em>words + morphemes</em> require simpler definitions and rules in
formalization.</p>
<p>However, the advantage in formalization does not mean these units
alone can describe cognition. For instance, there are a lot of idioms of
which the figurative meanings are different from their literal meanings.
The figurative meanings of idioms must be assessed holistically, and
that means idioms should be included as cognitive units. When Chomsky
attempted to formalize the language systems into <em>generative
grammar</em>, he considered only grammar, which is the set of rules
composing the minimal units into sentences, and regarded meaning and
pragmatics as secondary <span class="citation"
data-cites="Barman2012-li">(Barman 2012)</span>. His approach simplified
his formal system of language and facilitated the analysis of “regular”
language, but this system treats idioms as irregular exceptions <span
class="citation" data-cites="Almohizea2016-vu">(Almohizea 2016)</span>.
While generative grammar became mainstream linguistics from the middle
of the last century, its neglect of idioms and other shortcomings kept
drawing criticisms. Some of these criticisms spawned <em>usage-based
linguistics</em>, which regards all linguistic knowledge emerged from
embodied experience and language use in the real world. Usage-based
linguistics naturally allows idioms to be cognitive units, since idioms
are observable products of language use.</p>
<p>Usage-based linguistics softens the traditional, rigid definitions of
language units and makes the language units flexible in terms of sizes
and structures. Given this, one might assert that usage-based
linguistics should be able to describe cognitive units better than
formal linguistics in the style of Chomsky. Having said that,
usage-based linguistics is not developed in a unified frame, but is
developed in parallel theories, such as Cognitive Grammar <span
class="citation" data-cites="Langacker1987-fi">(R. W. Langacker
1987)</span>, Cognitive Construction Grammar (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Lakoff1987-cl">Lakoff (1987)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lakoff1987-cl">(1987)</span>, p. 467; <span class="citation"

<span class="citation" data-cites="Goldberg2006-gf">(2006)</span>), and
Radical Construction Grammar <span class="citation"
data-cites="Croft2001-vh">(Croft 2001)</span>. But at least, they share
the same terminology <em>construction</em> to describe the language
units.</p>
<p>We may wonder whether constructions are our expected cognitive units.
In general, construction means form-meaning or form-function pairing,
but its definition has been evolving several times. In the early days of
usage-based linguistics, Lakoff argued in “Linguistic Gestalts” (<span
class="citation" data-cites="Lakoff1977-jw">(1977)</span>) that the
meaning of an expression may be more than the additive meanings of its
parts, and Langacker said a construction contains two or more symbolic
components (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Langacker1987-fi">(1987)</span>, p. 82). They considered
constructions to be <em>complex</em> structures and serve as supplements
to the minimal units. However, since the 1990s, most researchers in
usage-based linguistics, such as Goldberg (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg1995-kz">(1995)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg2006-gf">(2006)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg2013-ci">(2013)</span>), Croft and Cruse (<span
class="citation" data-cites="Croft2004-ok">(2004)</span>), and even
Langacker himself (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Langacker2017-lf">(2017)</span>), used the notion of
construction also for minimal units. This extension integrated
morphemes, words, idioms, etc., which used to be described at different
linguistic levels, into a neat concept.</p>
<p>Another conceptual change of construction is on the constraint of
“unpredictability” or “non-decomposability”. Lakoff and Goldberg’s
Cognitive Construction Grammar is the most popular genre in construction
grammar, and its timeline illustrates this conceptual change. According
to Goldberg in her first book (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg1995-kz">(1995)</span>, p. 4), constructions should
not be strictly predictable from their component parts; in a later book
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Goldberg2006-gf">(2006)</span>,
p. 5), she privileged a condition: ”patterns are stored as constructions
even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient
frequency”. In a more recent book chapter (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg2013-ci">(2013)</span>), she loosened the constraint
further and refined the definition of construction as “conventional,
learned form-function pairings at varying levels of complexity and
abstraction”. The cancellation of “unpredictability”, together with the
cancellation of “complexity”, allows <em>any</em> expression, such as
“-ly”, “dog”, “I don’t know”, or “he is”, to be the constructions.</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence from psycholinguistic research showing
that the units in language cognition indeed span from morphemes <span

and Schiller 2011; MacGregor and Shtyrov 2013; Fiorentino et al. 2014;

2002; Bannard and Matthews 2008; Arnon and Snider 2010)</span>. It
seems, therefore, that the term <em>constructions</em>, in linguistics,
approximates the cognitive units I talk about in this thesis. However,
the definition of constructions still does not fully satisfy what I want
of cognitive units, because the constraint “conventional, learned” in
the new definition of construction <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg2013-ci">(Goldberg 2013)</span> creates a circular
argument if we ask for a discriminative statement rather than a
descriptive statement. A common approach to get around this plight is to
interpret “conventional, learned” as a matter of concrete frequency. But
we should note that the frequency effect cannot explain everything about
cognitive units: as an instance for low frequency, people may
immediately memorize the name of a new friend; as an instance for high
frequency, people may forget something that was once familiar.</p>
<p>In summary, the word, the morpheme, the idiom, as well as other
classical linguistic units, only describe part of cognitive units; the
construction, as a type of usage-based linguistic unit, represents the
notion of cognitive unit best among the linguistic units, but still not
perfectly. It remains necessary to study cognitive units from a variety
of perspectives.</p>
<div id="the-research-questions-of-cognitive-units">
<h3 id="ch1.the-research-questions-of-cognitive-units">The research
questions of cognitive units</h3>
</div>
<p>I have argued that cognitive units are rooted in language usage in
the above section, but also argued that the existing concepts in current
usage-based linguistics failed to give a formal, definite description of
cognitive units. To study what cognitive units are, we should examine
the reason for that failure.</p>
<p>The linguistic units assumed by current formal theories, e.g., words
and morphemes, lack flexibility, while they are well-defined and can be
easily identified in any language material. In contrast, usage-based
linguistics discards some of the rigidity of formal linguistics. But
units in usage-based linguistic theories are not defined consistently
yet, and outsider adopters from e.g. psycholinguistics or computational
linguistics cannot easily decide on a <em>suitable</em> definition given
the different variants of theories. Furthermore, even if we had decided
on a definition, the definition is still ambiguous for identifying the
units in given language material: The current typical solution for
usage-based linguists is to handcraft a vocabulary with linguistic
intuition, but this is not a generic solution for defining the units in
a general cognitive model. For these reasons, even psycholinguistic
studies, which require cognitive reality and plausibility, still often
adopt traditional linguistic units in their analyses.</p>
<p>In the current thesis, I will not dig into the divergence between
different linguistic theories. Rather, I will attempt to discover
cognitive units, adopting the flexibility of the usage-based view. I am
interested in formalizing the underlying principles that are analogous
to principles allowing humans to learn and use cognitive units. More
specifically, I will explore three questions about cognitive units:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span
id="ch1.what-will-be-learned-as-cognitive-units-during-language-acquisition"
label="ch1.what-will-be-learned-as-cognitive-units-during-language-acquisition"></span><strong>What
will be learned as cognitive units during language
acquisition?</strong><br />
Traditional studies of language acquisition usually talk about learning
words. Yet, words may not be the units of learning; perhaps the learning
of cognitive units should be the more generic research goal. Cognitive
units may be very different language chunks, but not just any language
chunk is a Cognitive unit (otherwise, the mental lexicon would be
unlimited). The flexibility of cognitive units implies that humans are
able to learn whether an arbitrary chunk in the language input is a
Cognitive unit without prior knowledge.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I propose the first research question on cognitive
units: what will be learned as cognitive units during language
acquisition? In Section <a
href="#ch1.from-linguistic-units-to-cognitive-units"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch1.from-linguistic-units-to-cognitive-units">1.3</a>, I
have mentioned that the definition of construction “conventional,
learned form-function pairings at varying levels of complexity and
abstraction” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberg2013-ci">(Goldberg 2013)</span> closely represents
cognitive units. But the prerequisite “<em>conventional or learned</em>”
in the definition is too vague since it does not answer anything about
what will be learned. This issue leads to the requirement of a formal
definition of cognitive units.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the above question implies <em>how to learn them</em>
because cognitive units are the results of learning. The two questions
are two sides of the same coin, but it is also interesting to
investigate more specific aspects of the learning.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="ch1.how-to-segment-language-input-into-cognitive-units"
label="ch1.how-to-segment-language-input-into-cognitive-units"></span><strong>How
to segment language input into cognitive units?</strong><br />
We can hardly read a sentence instantly. Instead, we segment the
sentence into smaller cognitive units. A similar effort is sentence
parsing, which has been well-studied. However, it is different from
cognitive units segmentation, because sentence parsing analyzes the
structure of complete sentences, while cognitive units segmentation may
operate on partial sentences as sentences are incrementally processed.
In other words, sentence parsing in the end requires the input to be
fully available, after which the parse can be established post-hoc,
while cognitive units segmentation should be modeled as an online task
that does not require the input to be finished or pre-segmented.</p>
<p>Moreover, cognitive units may vary in length or form, and they are
not always highlighted by perceptual cues in the language input. In
order to understand continuous language, readers must rely on their
experience to segment the language input into cognitive units. In other
words, the cognitive function for Cognitive unit segmentation in the
language input is based on the mental lexicon that stores learned
cognitive units.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I will investigate and model the mechanism of
cognitive units segmentation. The answer would not only contribute as a
psycholinguistic theory, but also provide a formal solution for sentence
segmentation in usage-based linguistics.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="ch1.how-to-process-segmented-cognitive-units"
label="ch1.how-to-process-segmented-cognitive-units"></span> <strong>How
to process segmented cognitive units?</strong><br />
A natural follow-up to the cognitive unit segmentation is the processing
of the segmented result. Through the processing of the cognitive units
and their relations, language input can be fully understood. However,
the investigation of this process is very complicated since it involves
many subprocesses (e.g., semantic access and syntactic composition of
these units) and the interaction between them. In this thesis, I attempt
to develop a concise framework to describe the processing of cognitive
units. More specifically, I will use the mechanism for scheduling
cognitive units of various grain sizes as the entry point for this
framework.</p>
<p>If only one Cognitive unit is segmented at each time step, there is
no question of which one to process. However, more cognitive units could
be segmented at the same time in the case that these units form a
hierarchical tree. For example, if <em>mail</em>, <em>box</em>, and
<em>mail box</em> are all stored in the mental lexicon, the whole form
and its components may all be segmented and activated. The multiple
candidates complicate subsequent processing: would the reader process
the cognitive units at different levels simultaneously, process only
some of them, or process some of them in advance? This is precisely the
scheduling question asked in this section.</p></li>

<div id="the-methodologies">
<h3 id="ch1.the-methodologies">The methodologies</h3>
</div>
<p>Language is the product of human cognition. However, traditional
studies of language usually start from language <em>per se</em>.
Chomsky, who claims linguistics is a branch of cognitive psychology
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Chomsky2006-wj">(2006)</span>,
p. 1), built his theories within the scope of language structure, using
as the cornerstone of his theory a controversial hypothesis -- the
innate grammar ability in the human brain. Even the schools of
usage-based linguistics, which do not use Chomsky’s hypothesis and
ground themselves in cognitive plausibility (which is why they are also
commonly referred to <em>cognitive linguistics</em>), focus on the
language phenomena to prove their consistency and completeness rather
than collecting cognitive evidence to prove their cognitive reality.</p>
<p>In investigating our research questions, I will start from
psycholinguistic methods, i.e., designing experiments to collect human
behavioral or neural responses to language material. By doing so, we may
obtain the empirical positive or negative evidence for our hypotheses on
cognitive units, and eventually, we may infer some key mechanisms of
language cognition that deal with these units. Specifically, this thesis
will involve the following experimental techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Behavioral approaches</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The philosophy behind behavioral experiments is that people’s
behaviors reflect the underlying cognitive procedure. Not any cognitive
procedure will result in overt or measurable behavior, but we may be
able to design a targeted task to force the cognitive procedure to show
a behavior. The <strong>Lexical decision task (LDT)</strong> is such a
task in psycholinguistics. In detail, LDT measures how quickly the
experiment participants classify the designed stimuli as words or
non-words. By comparing the reaction time between two types of stimuli
that are different on a linguistic attribute <em>X</em>, we can estimate
how <em>X</em> affects the processing time.</p>
<p>LDT requires reporting the decision of each stimulus, so the reading
should be interrupted often. In contrast, <strong>eye-tracking</strong>
can collect data during natural reading. This technique measures
people’s eye movement, so it requires no extra response, such as in LDT,
from the participants. An eye fixation usually reflects attention at the
fixation point. Using eye tracking instruments, researchers can record
and analyze the latencies, durations, and locations of fixations while
reading, to understand when, to what extent, and where the language
content is processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Neuroimaging</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive procedures may not always result in overt behaviors, but
they are certainly reflected by neural activities. Neuroimaging,
therefore, can provide more detail of our interested cognition
procedure. Some imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have
high spatial resolution and facilitate the discovery of the link between
brain areas to cognitive functions. Some imaging techniques, such as
<strong>electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> and magnetoencephalography
(MEG), have high temporal resolution and facilitate the discovery of the
temporal dynamics of cognitive functions.</p>
<p>The studies of this thesis will use EEG since the research questions
care about the temporal dynamics more than the brain areas of Cognitive
unit processing. The electrical activity in response to the processing
will conduct to the scalp, and EEG can record the electrical activity by
multiple electrodes attached to the scalp. Even though the EEG signal
reflects the brain activity with extremely short lag, which is much
better than the behavioral responses that also involve the time for
motor planning and muscle movement, we should notice that EEG cannot
reflect all cognitive activities and the EEG signal is complicated for
analysis. Thus, EEG is a complement, not a replacement, to the
behavioral techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the psycholinguistic methods, which mainly provide
scattered evidence for building our hypothesis of the processing
mechanism related to cognitive units, I will also build a learning
<strong>computational model</strong> to formalize the hypothesized
mechanism. Within computational models that learn from data, there are
two main branches: <em>supervised</em> models and <em>unsupervised</em>
models. <em>Supervised</em> means the data to feed into the model are
labeled as ground truth. Ground truths are taught by others. In human
learning, supervised ground-truth learning is rare, and most learning is
from our own experience of the world. Learning in the absence of labeled
ground truth is called <em>unsupervised</em> learning.</p>
<p>In case we had the ground truth of cognitive units, a supervised
computational model could fit itself to the data and then predict the
cognitive units in new cases. In reality, we lack a ground truth. More
importantly, children learning a language have no access to the ground
truth either. Only unsupervised computational models, therefore, are
acceptable for cognitive units discovery. Though an unsupervised
computational model does not need labeled data as ground truth, it
requires the learning target to guide the discovery from unlabeled data.
In order to make the model cognitively plausible, I will build on a
number of general cognitive principles to design the learning
target.</p>
<p>An unsupervised model does not require ground truth to fit. However,
it also means that it is difficult to know whether the unsupervised
model reflects cognitive reality if it is not tested on empirical
evidence. In order to evaluate the cognitive reality of our unsupervised
model, we will let the model do a psycholinguistic task that the model
should not have knowledge of. In our case, the task will be to predict
eye fixations during reading since our unsupervised model does not aim
to simulate the eye movements of humans, nor it is trained on
eye-fixation data. If the model succeeds, we could say the model does
conform to the cognitive reality of reading.</p>

<h3 id="ch1.the-roadmap-of-the-thesis">The roadmap of the thesis</h3>
</div>
<p>This thesis presents the discovery of the processing units in
language cognition. The discovery contains two parts: the first part
(Chapter <a href="ch2.html#ch2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch2">2</a>, <a href="ch3.html#ch3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch3">3</a>, and <a href="ch4.html#ch4" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch4">4</a>) describes laboratory studies that provide
empirical evidence to a theoretical model of the processing of cognitive
units; the second part (Chapter <a href="ch5.html#ch5" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch5">5</a> and <a href="ch6.html#ch6" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch6">6</a>) introduces a computational model, that
formalizes the learning and processing of cognitive units. The
computational model is based on the theoretical model.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="ch2.html#ch2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch2">2</a>, I will introduce a toolbox,
<em>EasyEEG</em>, which was developed for our subsequent analysis of EEG
data. EasyEEG includes several multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
methods to precisely examine the temporal dynamics of our interested
cognitive mechanisms. The MVPA methods require no background knowledge
of the ERP components and the sensor locations. This advantage is
critical to the studies in the next two chapters since the studies about
cognitive units are exploratory, which lacks the background knowledge.
In Chapter <a href="ch3.html#ch3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch3">3</a> and <a href="ch4.html#ch4" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch4">4</a>, I will present the behavioral and EEG
evidence for our hypotheses about cognitive units, and propose a
two-stage workflow to describe the processing of cognitive units.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="ch5.html#ch5" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch5">5</a>, I will present an unsupervised computational
model, <em>Less-is-Better</em> (<em>LiB</em>). This model can segment
any given text into sequences of units. The plausibility of the
model-derived units as <em>cognitive units</em> should be tested on a
realistic cognitive task namely, by the task related to empirical human
behavior. Therefore, in Chapter <a href="ch6.html#ch6" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ch6">6</a>, I will present the usage of the LiB model to
predict eye fixations during reading under the hypothesis that reading
units are cognitive units.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, I will summarize what I have found about
cognitive units, discuss the implications of the findings and the
theoretical connections to other domains, and propose some future
work.</p>
